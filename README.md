This is our hack as it was demoed. 

Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to implement all the features. 

We are considering continuation of the development, but not sure if its actually going to happen. 


Most of the use of Kloudless API is localized in app.js file, which is in root of the repo. And some more in the contollers/drives.js


I would have loved to do more with Kloudless api, however, we simply ran out of time, due to the lack of experience wiht projects this size, and node.js/express in general.
